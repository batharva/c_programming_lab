Statement Of Purpose 

	I am Atharva S Bhosale from Pune Maharashtra, a student of mehcnaical engg department at indian institute of technology tirupati. I joined this programm at iit as this was the best option available for me in JOSSA choices. I didn't have much idea about mechanical engg and its allied sub branches.

	Talking about my future goals, I was a computer geek right from the age of 2years. I started c++ at age of 11year when I was in class 6th, secured a silver badge on codechef, participated in contestes on codeforces. Continuing with my programming journey and a std of core engg  would like to some inovating product using my knowledge in both areas.
